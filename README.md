## Getting Started

Counter-culture.dev is a first-party OAuth 2.0 client application that consumes [counter-culture.client](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.client). It was designed to provide application developers with resources to learn, build and deploy third-party 0Auth 2.0 client applications for [counter-culture.io](https://counter-culture.io).

### Prerequisites 

Be sure to start [counter-culture.api](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.api) and [counter-culture.secure](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.secure) on ports `4000` and `5000`, respectively. Recall that this project consumes counter-culture.client, which proxies API calls to counter-culture.api and counter-culture.secure (see [Environment Modes](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.client#environment-modes)).

Counter-culture.dev also requires a `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. These values are autogenerated when [counter-culture.secure](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.secure) is launched (see [First-Party Clients](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.secure#first-party-clients)).

### Installation

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.dev.git

# enter the project root
cd counter-culture.dev

# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Once you've obtained your client ID and secret, find the `.demo.env` file in the project root, rename it to`.env`, and set the values accordingly:

```sh
# .env
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_ID={CLIENT_ID}
CLIENT_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Launching the App

```sh
# let it rip
npm run dev
```

## Usage

Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser. You can sign in using one of the [demo accounts](https://github.com/mrtillman/counter-culture.secure/blob/master/README.md#usage).
